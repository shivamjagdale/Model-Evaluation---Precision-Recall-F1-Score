# Model-Evaluation---Precision-Recall-F1-Score
Model Evaluation :- Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Here we are looking at different methods of model evaluation for Classification Models.
We use accuracy score most of the time in Classification models but it can't be accuracte when our dataset is imbalanced.

If we have an imbalanced data and if we want to see what type of predictions our model is making we can use confusion matrix.
Then to further understand you can plot the confusion matrix with seaborn to help understand the numbers better.

Our main goal here is to build an evaluation matrix that will give you a single score so that we can understand the performace of the model better.
So this is where Precision, Recall, F1 score comes into play.
